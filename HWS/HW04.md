# Q1
## Answer
The "standard deviation" of the original data measures how spread out the individual data points are in the sample. It captures the variability or dispersion within the dataset itself.
The "standard error of the mean" (SEM), on the other hand, is a measure of how much variability there is in the sample means across different possible samples drawn from the same population. It reflects the uncertainty or precision of the sample mean as an estimate of the population mean.

# Q2
## Answer

1. **Calculate the sample mean (X̄)**: This is the average of your data points.

2. **Compute the standard error of the mean (SEM)**: This is the standard deviation of your sample divided by the square root of the sample size (n).

   \[
   SEM = \frac{SD}{\sqrt{n}}
   \]

3. **Multiply the SEM by 1.96**: For a 95% confidence level, multiply the SEM by 1.96 (which comes from the z-score for a 95% confidence interval).

4. **Construct the confidence interval**: Take the sample mean (X̄) and add and subtract the value from step 3.

   \[
   \text{CI} = X̄ \pm 1.96 \times SEM
   \]

# Q3
## Answer
To create a 95% **bootstrapped confidence interval** using the bootstrapped sample means, I would do these steps:

1. **Resample your data**: Generate a large number of bootstrap samples (e.g., 10,000). Each sample is created by randomly drawing with replacement from your original dataset.

2. **Calculate the mean for each bootstrap sample**: For each of the resampled datasets, compute the mean.

3. **Sort the bootstrapped means**: Arrange all the calculated bootstrapped means in ascending order.

4. **Find the percentiles**: To form a 95% confidence interval, identify the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile of the sorted bootstrapped means. This range captures the middle 95% of the bootstrapped means.

   \[
   \text{CI} = \left[\text{2.5th percentile}, \text{97.5th percentile}\right]
   \]
