# Q1
## Answer
The "standard deviation" of the original data measures how spread out the individual data points are in the sample. It captures the variability or dispersion within the dataset itself.
The "standard error of the mean" (SEM), on the other hand, is a measure of how much variability there is in the sample means across different possible samples drawn from the same population. It reflects the uncertainty or precision of the sample mean as an estimate of the population mean.

# Q2
## Answer

1. **Calculate the sample mean (X̄)**: This is the average of your data points.

2. **Compute the standard error of the mean (SEM)**: This is the standard deviation of your sample divided by the square root of the sample size (n).

   \[
   SEM = \frac{SD}{\sqrt{n}}
   \]

3. **Multiply the SEM by 1.96**: For a 95% confidence level, multiply the SEM by 1.96 (which comes from the z-score for a 95% confidence interval).

4. **Construct the confidence interval**: Take the sample mean (X̄) and add and subtract the value from step 3.

   \[
   \text{CI} = X̄ \pm 1.96 \times SEM
   \]

# Q3
## Answer
To create a 95% **bootstrapped confidence interval** using the bootstrapped sample means, I would do these steps:

1. **Resample your data**: Generate a large number of bootstrap samples (e.g., 10,000). Each sample is created by randomly drawing with replacement from your original dataset.

2. **Calculate the mean for each bootstrap sample**: For each of the resampled datasets, compute the mean.

3. **Sort the bootstrapped means**: Arrange all the calculated bootstrapped means in ascending order.

4. **Find the percentiles**: To form a 95% confidence interval, identify the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile of the sorted bootstrapped means. This range captures the middle 95% of the bootstrapped means.

   \[
   \text{CI} = \left[\text{2.5th percentile}, \text{97.5th percentile}\right]
   \]

Let's walk through how to create a bootstrap confidence interval for a population mean, and then I'll explain how to modify the code for a different parameter, like the median.

### Step-by-step explanation of the process:

1. **Sample Generation**: If you don't have a real dataset, you can generate a sample. For simplicity, let's use a randomly generated sample from a normal distribution.
2. **Resampling**: To create a bootstrap sample, you resample from your original sample *with replacement*. This mimics drawing a new sample from the population.
3. **Statistic Calculation**: For each bootstrap sample, calculate the statistic you're interested in (mean, median, etc.).
4. **Confidence Interval Construction**: After repeating the resampling process many times (say, 10,000 times), you can estimate the confidence interval by taking the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the bootstrap distribution.

Let’s write the code for a 95% confidence interval for the **mean** first, then I'll explain how to adapt it for the **median**.

### Bootstrap for Population Mean
```python
import numpy as np

# Step 1: Generate a sample (you can replace this with your actual sample)
np.random.seed(0)  # For reproducibility
sample = np.random.normal(loc=50, scale=10, size=100)

# Step 2: Define a function to perform bootstrap sampling and compute the confidence interval
def bootstrap_ci_mean(sample, num_bootstrap=10000, ci=95):
    bootstrapped_means = []
    
    # Step 3: Generate bootstrap samples and calculate the mean for each sample
    for _ in range(num_bootstrap):
        bootstrap_sample = np.random.choice(sample, size=len(sample), replace=True)
        bootstrapped_means.append(np.mean(bootstrap_sample))
    
    # Step 4: Compute the confidence interval percentiles
    lower_percentile = (100 - ci) / 2
    upper_percentile = 100 - lower_percentile
    confidence_interval = np.percentile(bootstrapped_means, [lower_percentile, upper_percentile])
    
    return confidence_interval

# Step 5: Calculate and print the 95% confidence interval for the mean
ci_mean = bootstrap_ci_mean(sample)
print(f"95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval for the Mean: {ci_mean}")
```

### Explanation:
- We generate 10,000 bootstrap samples from the original sample.
- For each bootstrap sample, we calculate the mean.
- Finally, we take the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the means to form the 95% confidence interval.

### Modifying the Code for the Median:
To change this code to calculate the 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the **median** instead of the mean, all we need to do is replace the `np.mean` function with `np.median`.

```python
def bootstrap_ci_median(sample, num_bootstrap=10000, ci=95):
    bootstrapped_medians = []
    
    # Generate bootstrap samples and calculate the median for each sample
    for _ in range(num_bootstrap):
        bootstrap_sample = np.random.choice(sample, size=len(sample), replace=True)
        bootstrapped_medians.append(np.median(bootstrap_sample))
    
    # Compute the confidence interval percentiles
    lower_percentile = (100 - ci) / 2
    upper_percentile = 100 - lower_percentile
    confidence_interval = np.percentile(bootstrapped_medians, [lower_percentile, upper_percentile])
    
    return confidence_interval

# Calculate and print the 95% confidence interval for the median
ci_median = bootstrap_ci_median(sample)
print(f"95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval for the Median: {ci_median}")
```

### Key Changes:
- The only major change is in how we calculate the statistic for each bootstrap sample: in this case, we calculate the median instead of the mean using `np.median`.

Try running this code and rephrase the comments in your own words to ensure you've fully grasped it. If you have any questions, let me know!

## Personal 
So basically here is the python code for it.

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a sample of data
sample = np.random.randn(100)  # Example sample: 100 random data points from a normal distribution

# Set up parameters for bootstrapping
n_bootstraps = 10000  # Number of bootstrap samples
bootstrapped_means = []  # List to store the means from each bootstrap sample

# Bootstrap procedure
for _ in range(n_bootstraps):
    # Resample with replacement from the original sample
    bootstrap_sample = np.random.choice(sample, size=len(sample), replace=True)
    
    # Calculate the statistic of interest: mean in this case
    bootstrapped_means.append(np.mean(bootstrap_sample))

# Calculate the 95% confidence interval from the bootstrapped means
lower_bound = np.percentile(bootstrapped_means, 2.5)  # 2.5th percentile
upper_bound = np.percentile(bootstrapped_means, 97.5)  # 97.5th percentile

print(f"95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval for the Mean: [{lower_bound}, {upper_bound}]")

# To calculate the bootstrap confidence interval for the median instead of the mean,
# simply change np.mean(bootstrap_sample) to np.median(bootstrap_sample) in the loop.
```

### Here is the Explanation of the Code:
1. **Sample Creation**: We simulate a random sample of data (`sample`) to represent the dataset from which we'll compute the population parameter (mean in this case). In this example, `np.random.randn(100)` generates 100 random numbers from a standard normal distribution.

2. **Bootstrap Setup**: We define `n_bootstraps` as 10,000, meaning we will generate 10,000 new datasets (bootstrap samples) by randomly resampling (with replacement) from our original sample. 

3. **Bootstrap Procedure**: 
   - For each bootstrap iteration, we randomly resample from the original dataset.
   - Then, we calculate the **mean** of each resampled dataset and store it in the list `bootstrapped_means`.

4. **Confidence Interval Calculation**: After generating 10,000 bootstrapped means, we find the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles to create a 95% confidence interval. This interval contains the middle 95% of the bootstrapped means.

### Modifying for Other Population Parameters:
- To compute a **95% bootstrap confidence interval for the median** instead of the mean, change the line where we calculate the statistic:

```python
bootstrapped_means.append(np.median(bootstrap_sample))
```

This code change will calculate the **median** for each bootstrap sample, and the rest of the process remains the same.
